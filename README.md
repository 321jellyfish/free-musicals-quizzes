# free-musicals-quizzes

This is the first website I coded myself from scratch. It's a series of quizzes about different musicals, organised into categories. The home page is a directory of the quizzes and serves as the main navigation. 

This project was made with:
- HTML
- CSS
- A mobile-first design

Overall I enjoyed the challenge of making this website. My biggest challenge was getting the CSS to work well.

In the future I aim to:
- Make the website responsive
